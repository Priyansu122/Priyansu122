## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I am [Priyansu sahoo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyansu-sahoo/), an Electronics and Communication Engineer. Welcome to my Github profile.
- I have completed my undergraduation(BTech in ECE) in [Silicon University](https://www.linkedin.com/school/silicontech-bbs/) in 2024.
### My Journey
- Being a electronics strudent, My journey in VLSI started in my 2rd year.
- During my 2rd year i have completed a course on "Digital design" where i got knowledge in Hardware description language, Digital design and basics of full custom
  design, layouts etc.
- In my 3rd year, i have completed a course in "Digital verification" in which i got knowledge on basics of verification enviroment and system verilog.
- In my final year i got a oppertunity to do insternship in [Advance VLSI lab, SIT](https://www.linkedin.com/company/silicon-vlsi/)
- There we are exposed to different domains of vlsi like </br>
  1. Cell characterization
  2. Standard cell layout
  3. Process design kit(PDK) training etc.

<!--
- My first comapny is [CoreEL technologies](

    - Basic understanding of CMOS SRAM design and Memory Compiler.
    - Knowledge of CMOS Layout and Scribe Line Layout.
    - Basic understanding of FPGA implementation.
    - Created a temperature sensing circuit using PT100 with LabVIEW interface.
    - Basic training in Logic Synthesis and Static Timing Analysis (STA).
    - Having knowledge about STA, Delay Model & calculation, and familiar with OpenSTA.
    - Familiar with different IO files used in a VLSI flow.
    - Fundamentally strong in Digital/Analog Electronics, Control System, & Analog Communication & Digital Signal Processing.
    - Familiar with Embedded Programming,Experienced in several IoT projects.

- Education:

| Passout Year  | Instituition  | Course | Grade |
| ------------- | ------------- | -----  | ----- |
| 2022  | Silicon Institute Of Technology, Bhubaneswar  | B.tech(ECE) | 9.58 |
| 2018  | Sri Aurobindo Science College, Cuttack  | 12th PCMB | 87.63% |
| 2016  | Saraswati Shishu Vidya Mandir, Jagatsinghpur | 10th | 90.33% |

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 28nm CMOS Layout Design
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Digital and Analog Physical Design Flow
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Projects related to VLSI Design
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Analog Circuit Design
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I will help from my knowledge base
