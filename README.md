## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I am [Priyansu sahoo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyansu-sahoo/), an Electronics and Communication Engineer. Welcome to my Github profile.
- I have completed my undergraduation(BTech in ECE) in [Silicon University](https://www.linkedin.com/school/silicontech-bbs/) in 2024.
### My Journey
- Started my career in IoT during my first year as an electronics student.
- Transitioned to VLSI in my second year.
- Completed a "Digital Design" course, gaining expertise in HDL, digital design, and custom layouts.
- In my third year, completed a "Digital Verification" course, learning about verification environments and SystemVerilog.
- Interned at the Advanced VLSI Lab, SIT in my final year, gaining exposure to:</br>
     - Cell characterization
     - Standard cell layout
     - PDK training
- Worked with FPGAs, including the Spartan6.
- Conducted a workshop on RTL to GDS flow using open-source tools for juniors.

### Skills
- **Tools** </br>
  1. Xilinx, Cadence Virtuoso, Calibre, Spectre, Sue2, CppSim
  2. Open Source tools like Iverilog, Gtkwave, Yosys, Openroad flow, nextpnr etc.          - 
- **Programming** - C, Python, Verilog(HDL)
- **Productivity** - MS Office

### Projects
Some of the major projects that i have done in my academic carrer are :
- [**16 byte SRAM design**](https://github.com/Priyansu122/SRAM-Project-2023): </br>
    Designed a 16-byte SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) using the 180nm technology node, employing a full custom approach.
- [**Digital Temperature Monitor**](https://github.com/silicon-efabless/tt06-silicon-tinytapeout-lm07?tab=readme-ov-file#project-description): </br>
    - This project implements a digital temperature monitor by connecting a temperature sensor ([LM70](docs/datasheet-LM70-TI-tempSensor.pdf) [`docs/datasheet-LM70-TI-tempSensor.pdf`]) and a three-segment display to measure and display a range of $0-99^\circ C$ or $0-99^\circ F$ with an accuracy of $\pm 2^\circ C$.
    - In this project, I have enhanced the design by adding several new features and ensuring it is ready for fabrication using the [Tiny Tapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/) platform.

- [**MQTT BASED GAS ALERTING SYSTEM**](): </br>
    - This project implements a digital temperature monitor by connecting a temperature sensor ([LM70](docs/datasheet-LM70-TI-tempSensor.pdf) [`docs/datasheet-LM70-TI-tempSensor.pdf`]) and a three-segment display to measure and display a range of $0-99^\circ C$ or $0-99^\circ F$ with an accuracy of $\pm 2^\circ C$.
    - I was a contributor in this project.
